### Competitive Programming

The CP directory is organized by platform and contains solutions to contest problems from:
- **AtCoder**: Popular Japanese competitive programming platform
- **Codeforces**: One of the most popular CP platforms worldwide
- **LeetCode Contests**: Weekly and biweekly contest solutions

## 🛠️ How to Use

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++, clang++, or any C++11/14/17 compatible compiler)
- Basic understanding of C++ and data structures

### Compiling and Running

To compile any C++ file:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o output_file filename.cpp
./output_file
```

Example:
```bash
# Compile Two Sum problem
g++ -std=c++17 -o twosum DSA/arrays/TwoSum.cpp

# Run the compiled program
./twosum
```

### For Windows Users
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 filename.cpp -o output_file.exe
output_file.exe
```

## 📖 Learning Path

If you're new to DSA, here's a recommended order to explore the problems:

1. **Start with Arrays**: Basic operations, searching, and sorting
2. **Move to Recursion**: Understand recursive thinking and base cases
3. **Explore Linked Lists**: Learn about pointer manipulation and node operations
4. **Practice Strings**: String algorithms and pattern matching
5. **Advanced Topics**: Backtracking, dynamic programming, and optimization

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add more problems or improve existing solutions:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-problem`)
3. Add your solution with clear comments
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add solution for XYZ problem'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-problem`)
6. Open a Pull Request

### Contribution Guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Follow consistent coding style
- Test your solution before submitting

## 📝 Code Style

All solutions in this repository follow these conventions:
- **Language**: C++ (C++11 or higher)
- **Naming**: CamelCase for file names
- **Classes**: Use `Solution` class for problem implementations
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex algorithms
